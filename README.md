# HEAD:Holistic Evolutionary Autonomous Driving
HEAD is a holistic suite of evolutionary autonomous driving software, based on the MetaDrive simulation platform, that seamlessly imports driving scenarios, uploads training models, and efficiently performs continuous training designed to significantly improve the performance of arbitrary models.
## Introduction
**HEAD (Holistic Evolutionary Autonomous Driving)** is an Autonomous Driving Platform with the following key features: 
- **A General Self-Evolutionary Autonomous Driving Software Tool**: It combines learning-based, optimization-based, and rule-based algorithms to efficiently handle complex driving scenarios and ensure safety and performance.
- **Integration with Simulation Testing**: It is deeply integrated with the MetaDrive simulation platform, enabling comprehensive testing and optimization.
- **A Closed-Loop Data-Driven Platform**: It provides a complete closed-loop system from scenario generation to algorithm evolution, enhancing adaptability and reliability in unseen scenarios through adversarial testing and continuous learning.
